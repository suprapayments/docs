This page describes the checkout process that customers go through when buying a product. It is a good idea for sellers to become familiar with the checkout process.

<Note>
  If you want to try out the checkout process without setting up your own
  product, you can follow along on the Cardano testnet with [this example

# Connecting a Wallet

The first step for a user is to connect the browser wallet. Almost well-known browser wallets are compatible.

Clicking "Connect" reveals a dropdown with the available wallet options.

Once the visitor has connected their wallet, they will see the next screen.

# Pay with ADA

The next screen prompts the user to click a button which registers the interaction with Supra and causes us to initialise the transaction. All Supra transactions are multi-signature (meaning both we and the customer must sign the transaction) as this is a security best-practice.

Once the transaction has been created, the wallet prompts the user to sign and confirm the transaction.

# Thank-you Screen/Redirect

The final step of the checkout process shows a thank you screen.
If a redirect step was set up, a brief timer will show before directing the user to the redirect page.
