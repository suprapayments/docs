In this page we will cover how to,

- Set the price of a product in native tokens

The most up-to-date list of supported tokens can be found in our [FAQ](https://suprapayments.io/pricing#faq).

# Setting a product's price in Native Tokens

A product's price can be set in any of the tokens supported by Supra.

To edit the currency of a product, click edit on the product information panel:

The currency can then be edited from the dropdown in field labelled `Price`:

# Accepting Native Tokens at Checkout

You have the ability to only accept payments in a subset of the tokens available. The list of the accepted tokens can be seen in the product information panel. This appears as a list of checkboxes when in "Edit" mode.

To modify the list of accepted tokens, use the checkboxes to indicate which of the tokens you want to accept.

The `Select/Deselect All` button can be used to quickly toggle all of the tokens as selected/unselected.

Once you have made your choice of tokens to accept, click save to update the product information.

A list of the accepted tokens is then shown in the Product Information panel.

Any checkout links referring to this product will now only show these accepted tokens as available options for payment.

# Paying with Native Tokens

Customers can choose the token in which they'd like to make their payment from the checkout page. By default, the currency in which the product's price was specified is shown. The USD value of the product is also shown to customers.

The payment currency can be easily changed using the dropdown menu.

With the currency selected, the customer can continue the rest of the checkout process as normal.

The completed payment will then show in the seller's dashboard, just like payments in ADA.
