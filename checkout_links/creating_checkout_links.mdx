Checkout links are the primary way customers can purchase products with Supra.

Checkout links are a versatile way of accepting payments on the web, since all they rely on is having a hyperlink, which are a basic element of the internet. This means checkout links can be used on all sorts of platforms, from WordPress, to Shopify sites, to emails, to a custom website.

# How to create a Checkout Link

Each product page has a section dedicated to checkout links. To find it on a product page, scroll down to the panel titled "Checkout Links".

# How can I share/view my Checkout Link?

The link can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the copy icon.

You can open the link in a new tab by clicking the open in new tab icon.

Once you have the link, the link can be shared anywhere that will accept hyperlinks.

# What settings can I edit for my Checkout Link?

The redirect section allows you to automatically redirect the customer after they have successfully completed a payment. The use-cases for this could be to:

- Send the customer back to your website
- Send the customer to a "thank-you page"
- Send the customer to a link where they can download any digital assets they purchased.

To set this up, click the pencil icon, which makes the redirect field editable:

Then enter the address you would like to redirect the customer to, and check the checkbox.

Click save once you are done. As long as the checkbox is ticked, the checkout link will redirect the user after their purchase has gone through.
