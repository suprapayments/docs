Supra has a concept of "Environments". These act as independent spaces in which you can add products and try out checkout processes.

Supra provides two environments to each user, one "Test" environment and one "Live" environment. Transactions related to products added to the "Test" enviroment will only ever take place on the Cardano testnet, whereas products added to the "Live" environment will take place on mainnet.

- When switching to the Test environment, you may notice this is reflected in the currency symbols, which will have a "t" prefix to denote "testnet", e.g. "₳" becomes "t₳".

The purpose of the Test enviroment is to give merchants a space where they can experiment and try out Supra while keeping their main account more organized.

# Switching Environments

The environment menu is available in the sidebar, and lets you switch between the "Test" and "Live" environments.
