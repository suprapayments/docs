Supra uses a concept called `Environments` to manage independent spaces for your organization. Each independent space allows you to add products and try out checkout processes without altering the other environments.

Two environments are provided to each organization: one `Test` environment and one `Live` environment. Transactions related to products added to the `Test` enviroment take place exclusively on the Cardano testnet, whereas transactions associated with products in the `Live` environment will take place on mainnet.

<Note>
  In the `Test` environment, you may notice that all currency units are prefixed
  with a "t" to denote "testnet", e.g. "₳" becomes "t₳".
</Note>

The purpose of the `Test` enviroment is to give merchants a space where they can experiment with Supra while keeping their main account organized.

# The Environment Menu

The environment menu is accessible from the sidebar, and lets you switch between the `Test` and `Live` environments.
