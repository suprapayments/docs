Supra uses a concept called `Environments` to manage independent spaces for your organization. These act as independent spaces in which you can add products and try out checkout processes.

Supra provides two environments to each user, one `Test` environment and one `Live` environment. Transactions related to products added to the `Test` enviroment will only ever take place on the Cardano testnet, whereas products added to the `Live` environment will take place on mainnet.

<Note>
  In the `Test` environment, you may notice that all currency units are prefixed
  with a "t" to denote "testnet", e.g. "₳" becomes "t₳".
</Note>

The purpose of the `Test` enviroment is to give merchants a space where they can experiment with Supra while keeping their main account organized.

# The Environment Menu

The environment menu is accessible from the sidebar, and lets you switch between the `Test` and `Live` environments.
