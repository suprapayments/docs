By "testnet" we are always referring to Cardano's [pre-production network](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/).

To test purchasing products on the testnet, testnet ADA (tâ‚³) can be obtained from the [Cardano faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet/).

Instructions for changing your wallet settings to connect using the pre-production network are listed below.
