# Organization Settings

The Organization settings page can be reached by clicking the `Settings` link in the dashboard's sidebar.

When you first visit the settings page, it should look similar to the following screenshot.

To update the name, simply type a name that is fitting for your Organization. For our demo example, we will pretend our Organization is called "Rocket Labs".

To edit the Logo used for the organization, click the `Change` button and select a file for the image you would like to use.

# Cardano Withdrawal Addresses

## Mainnet Withdrawal Address

This is the mainnet Cardano address, where you would like funds to be sent when customers pay for an item. These are standard addresses on the Cardano network, and they must always begin with `addr1` followed by the remainder of the address.

## Testnet Withdrawal Address

Adding a testnet address could be useful, as this allows you to test the account and test the checkout pages without risking any real (mainnet) tokens.

Supra uses the preproduction network for testnet transactions.

Preproduction network addresses will always begin with `addr_test1`. It is not necessary to add a testnet address to use your Supra account.
