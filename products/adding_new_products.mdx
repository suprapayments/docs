## The Product Information Section

## The Customer Information Section

The Customer Information Section offers ability to collect a variety of information from the customer during the checkout process. This information will be displayed on the [Payments page](/payments/page) along with other information about the payment.

Remember to click `Save` once you have finished editing this section.

### Collect Custom Information

Custom information can be requested of the customer (for example asking what text a customer would like on an engraving). To do this click the `+ Add Question` button from the Custom Information area.

Once a new question has been added, you can type your own question in the "Question text" input, and choose an input type. These allow you to vary the number of lines of text the user can enter.

### Variable Quantity

If customers should only be able to buy one a single unit of the item at a time, leave the variable quantity checkbox unchecked.

Otherwise, if you would like to allow customers to order multiple units of an item at once, check the variable quantity checkbox. Doing so will reveal fields for Minimum Quantity and Maximum Quantity which allow you to limit the size of the customer's order.

## The Inventory Section

The Inventory Section provides options to track and update the amount of the product you have in stock, and prevent the sale of more items when the item is out of stock. If you do not need to manage your stock through the product page, you can leave the "Track Inventory" field unchecked.

If you would like to track your stock, checking the "Track Inventory" checkbox will reveal some more settings.

The Quantity field lets you specify how much of the item you currently have available. This will be decremented by one on each sale (or the appropriate quantity if you allowed customers to choose a [variable quantity](#variable-quantity) in the Customer Information section).

"Continue Selling when Out of Stock" lets you keep track of your stock, but will allow customers to keep making purchases even when your quantity reaches zero.

Click save to update the product.

## The Checkout Links Section

The Checkout Links section allows you to create checkout links for the product you created.

When there are no checkout links it will look similar to the following image.

To add a checkout link, click `New Checkout Link`. You will see a new row in the panel.

This section is covered in more detail in the dedicated [Checkout Links]()
page. For now, you can click on the â†— icon to view the checkout link for
your product.

# The Payments Tab
