To add a new product, click the `+ New Product` button.

Once the new product is created the site will direct you to the product's page, where you can enter the information for the product.

## The Product Information Section

The Product Information section allows you to manage the most basic and important information about the product. Click on the `Edit` button at the top-right of the panel to switch it into edit mode.

When in edit mode, it is possible to modify a variety of fields.

Use the Name input to give a brief title to your product.

The Description field allows for a longer description of the product.

The Image field lets you add an image for your product and accepts a variety of image formats.

The Price field lets you enter a decimal value for the price, and the currency can be selected using the dropdown menu.

The Accepted Tokens option presents a list of checkboxes, which you may check/uncheck if you want to allow customers to pay in those tokens as currencies for the transaction. The conversion calculations will be done based on up-to-date prices at the checkout page.

The `Select/Deselect All` button allows you to rapidly toggle all checkboxes as selected/unselected.

Make sure to click `Save` when you are done to save your changes.

## The Customer Information Section

The Customer Information Section offers ability to collect a variety of information from the customer during the checkout process. This information will be displayed on the [Payments page](/payments/page) along with other information about the payment.

Remember to click `Save` once you have finished editing this section.

Once a new question has been added, you can type your own question in the "Question text" input, and choose an input type. These allow you to vary the number of lines of text the user can enter.

### Variable Quantity

If customers should only be able to buy one a single unit of the item at a time, leave the variable quantity checkbox unchecked.

Otherwise, if you would like to allow customers to order multiple units of an item at once, check the variable quantity checkbox. Doing so will reveal fields for Minimum Quantity and Maximum Quantity which allow you to limit the size of the customer's order.

## The Inventory Section

The Inventory Section provides options to track and update the amount of the product you have in stock, and prevent the sale of more items when the item is out of stock. If you do not need to manage your stock through the product page, you can leave the "Track Inventory" field unchecked.

If you would like to track your stock, checking the "Track Inventory" checkbox will reveal some more settings.

The Quantity field lets you specify how much of the item you currently have available. This will be decremented by one on each sale (or the appropriate quantity if you allowed customers to choose a [variable quantity](#variable-quantity) in the Customer Information section).

"Continue Selling when Out of Stock" lets you keep track of your stock, but will allow customers to keep making purchases even when your quantity reaches zero.

Click save to update the product.

## The Checkout Links Section

The Checkout Links section allows you to create checkout links for the product you created.

When there are no checkout links it will look similar to the following image.

To add a checkout link, click `New Checkout Link`. You will see a new row in the panel.

page. For now, you can click on the â†— icon to view the checkout link for
your product.
